# CodeAlpha_Credit-Scoring-Model

This project is a Machine Learning-based **Credit Scoring Model** developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Internship Program**. The model helps evaluate the creditworthiness of applicants based on financial, demographic, and behavioral data.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not. This aids financial institutions in making informed credit decisions.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Predicts **loan default risk** (Good Credit / Bad Credit)
- Uses **logistic regression** and other ML algorithms
- Includes **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**
- Outputs performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🗂️ Dataset

A sample financial dataset with features like:

- Age, Gender, Income
- Credit History
- Loan Amount & Term
- Employment Status, etc.

> *(Dataset is used for educational purposes only.)*
